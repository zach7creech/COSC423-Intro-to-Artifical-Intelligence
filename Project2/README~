This file 'main.py' contains the implementation for class PathPlanner as well as
the driving code in main() to accept command line arguments to utilize the class.
The class contains 3 search functions, two uninformed BFS and DFS, and one informed
A* that utlizes Euclidean distance as its heuristic. It also contains two helper
functions, inBounds to determine if a node has already been visited, is outside the
grid, or is a 'wall' (a 1), and printPath that will print the path returned by each
of the search functions. This file also contains implementation for class Node that
each traversed pair of indices is stored as. Contains a node's i,j coordinates and
a pointer to its parent, which is helpful for printing the final path.

To run this code locally in a Unix environment, place 'main.py' in the same directory
as a file that contains a NxM grid composed entirely of 0s, 1s, and commas separating
each entry. In a terminal, within that directory, run the following command:
'python3 main.py --input FILENAME --start START_NODE --goal GOAL_NODE --search SEARCH_TYPE'
where SEARCH_TYPE can be BFS, DFS, astar, or ALL to run the respective search.
Ordering of the commands is very important, as the program will not run otherwise. Output
will be printed to the terminal.
