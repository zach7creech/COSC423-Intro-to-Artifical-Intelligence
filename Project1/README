This program contains definitions for four functions. These four functions evaluate applicants
based on their GPAs in their 5 CS courses and their non-CS GPA. A list of applicants' GPAs are
read from a .csv file 'applicants.csv', processed through each of the four functions, and if
the applicant passes all four functions (each returns True), the applicant's resume is passed
on to HR. If not, the applicant is rejected. The results are written to a .csv file
'results.csv', with each line corresponding to each line from applicants.csv, 'ACCEPT' if 
accepted and 'REJECT' if rejected.

To run this code locally in a Unix environment, place 'main.py' in the same directory as a file
of applicants called 'applicants.csv'. In a terminal, within that directory, run the following
command: 'python3 main.py' to run the code and output the results to a file called 'results.csv'
in the same directory.

Ethical Statement: If Moogle wishes to vet its applicants in such an abitrary manner, then that
is their perogative. The algorithm is ethical in the sense that it bases an applicant's worth
solely on merit (albeit a very small subspace of what could be considered 'merit'). I do not
believe that this algorithm necessarily violates any hiring laws in the U.S., but I do not believe
that this is a useful way to choose potential employees.
